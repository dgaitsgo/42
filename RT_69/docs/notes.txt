dgaitsgo :

- Objects are not dynamicaly allocated and the structures : t_sphere, t_cone, t_cylinder, t_cone don't serve much
- Big problems :
	- No tone mapping - e.g. 125 is half bright as 255
	- Generating shadow rays is inefficient : intersection routine looks for nearest object,
		not IF an object is between the intersected object and the light
	- edge cases for when capped objects (cylinder, cone) are parellel - for now the code checks if the object is exactly parallel
		and shifts it slightly throught the transformation matrix
